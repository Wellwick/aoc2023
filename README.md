# Advent of Code 2023
Advent of Code 2023, this time in Rust!

I have never written in Rust before, so there is a playground area to learn the
basics of Rust. I'm using
[Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/) for this,
but also the much more concise
[fasterthanli.me](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust)
article on Rust.
